## 7.5.1 What did I learn in this module?
In this module, you learned that it may be necessary to combine data from more than one table for an analysis. Typically, combining data from more than one table is done using a SQL JOIN function. You used SQL queries to perform the four different types of JOINS: INNER, OUTER, LEFT and RIGHT. You can use DML commands to create new tables, add rows and columns, and modify data contained in the table. You also learned that, in addition to relational databases, data may be stored in other formats known as NoSQL data stores.
