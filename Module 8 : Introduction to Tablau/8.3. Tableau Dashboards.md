## 8.3.1 Introduction to Dashboards
It is time to learn about Tableau dashboards. A dashboard is a way to display information in Tableau that consolidates multiple views or visualizations.
Tableau dashboard provides real-time data from multiple visualizations all in one window. It allows users to compare and monitor a variety of data visualizations simultaneously. Presenting information in this way makes it easier for audiences to understand data and make appropriate decisions quickly.

## 8.3.2 Static and Live Data
Dashboards can contain live or static data. Static data includes things like screen shots or snapshots of data. This allows for tightly controlled point-in-time narratives of the data; however, static data begins to lose value immediately and continues to lose value over time. Live data, on the other hand, is used for dashboards that are automatically updated. This gives your audience the most up-to-date data at all times, allowing for immediate action if data changes frequently.

## 8.3.3 Dashboard Benefits
There are several benefits to using dashboards to present your data.
1. Dashboards give access to data and reports from multiple data sources on a single screen, simplifying analysis.
2. Information is presented in a dynamic interface that is easy to use and understand.
3. Dashboards can allow users to filter and isolate individual metrics, zoom into maps or line plots for more detail, and develop detailed analytical reports.

## 8.3.4 Dashboard Best Practices
Before creating a dashboard there are a few best practices to observe:
1. Know your audience and understand what information they need.
2. Present relevant and clean data.
3. Select visualizations that best represent your data.
4. Use templates to reduce time and complexity.
5. Avoid cluttering the dashboard space with too many annotations or colors.
6. Use feedback to refine and improve the dashboard design.

## 8.3.5 Creating a New Dashboard
You can add as many views or sheets to a dashboard as you want. There is no limit.
Each view you add to the dashboard stays connected to its corresponding worksheet. This means that when you change or modify any of the worksheets, the dashboard views are also updated. And, if you modify any of views in the dashboard, the corresponding worksheet is updated.
Dashboards are a great way to present all relevant visualizations and information on one page or screen to your audience, so they do not have to navigate to other tabs or screens.
