<br/>
In many cases, the data that we need to work with is contained in a database, either locar or remote. A database is a repository of data with a defined structure. Databases are usually designed, built, and populated with data for a specific purpose.
<br/>
A schema describes the design and structure of the database, including the table names, fields, data types, and the relationship between these entities.
Database also contains metadata. Metadata is data about data. When looking at a database, the metadata tells you information about what is contained within the database.
<br/>
DBMS softward products are often referred to as servers in a client server environment. DBMS are more than just applications running on the server. They are complex pieces of software that enables users and applidations to interact with underlying data.
<br/>
NoSQL Databases are a relatively new form of database in that they are characterised by a flexible schema with the ability to scale both the number of characters and fields in a record, and the number of records.
