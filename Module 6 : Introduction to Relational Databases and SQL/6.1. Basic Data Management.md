## 6.1.1 Introduction to Databases

<br/>
In many cases, the data that we need to work with is contained in a database, either locar or remote. A database is a repository of data with a defined structure. Databases are usually designed, built, and populated with data for a specific purpose.
<br/>
A schema describes the design and structure of the database, including the table names, fields, data types, and the relationship between these entities.
Database also contains metadata. Metadata is data about data. When looking at a database, the metadata tells you information about what is contained within the database.
<br/>
DBMS softward products are often referred to as servers in a client server environment. DBMS are more than just applications running on the server. They are complex pieces of software that enables users and applidations to interact with underlying data.
<br/>
NoSQL Databases are a relatively new form of database in that they are characterised by a flexible schema with the ability to scale both the number of characters and fields in a record, and the number of records.

## 6.1.2 Flat File Databases
Flat file databases can also be in plain text format. A common example of this type of flat file database is a CSV, or comma-separated values, file. Here, there are no cells, as in a spreadsheetâ€”instead, information in each row is separated by plain text characters, called delimiters, such as commas.
<br/>
Flat files are good for simple data, and you will use them in many scenarios. However, if you need to store large amounts of complex data, the flat file system quickly becomes inefficient. Flat files are also prone to some types of errors. One of these common problems is called data inconsistency.

## 6.1.3 Limitations of Flat Files
When the structure of data starts to be more complex, it cannot be efficiently stored in a flat file database.

## 6.1.4 Relational Databases
It keeps related types of data in tables, and each table can have relationships with other tables that jink all the information together.
