The fourth step in the Data Analytics Process is preparing data for analysis. Datasets often contain blank rows or columns, data in the wrong formats, or corrupt field entries. All of these things can make the results of any analysis incorrect, so these datasets need to be cleaned and transformed prior to analysis. In this module, you will dive deep into analysing data with Excel. You will use Excel to import, clean and prepare the data for the visualisations.
