## 4.1.1 Organising Data with Sorting and Filtering in Excel

Video
<br/>
You may need to sort and/or filter your data to prepare for data analysis and/or to display specific critical data. Excel has built-in simple sorting and filtering options.
Within columns, sorting can be done in ascending or descending order. Filters are used to display data that meets specific defined requirements.
To organise data and to immediately identify anomalies, we use both the sort and filter features in Excel. Sort can act on a single column or multiple columns of information.
