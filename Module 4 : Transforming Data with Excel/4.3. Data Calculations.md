## 4.3.1 Formulas and Functions

Video
There are a number of functions that can be entered on the formula bar that are commonly used by data professionals.
|Function|Explanation|
|-----|-----|
|CONCATENATE|Combine the data from one or more columns into a single column.|
|LEN|Return the number of characters in a cell and can be useful if data must be utilised in another application that has restrictions on the size of fields.|
|COUNT|Return the number of numeric cells in a range. This is especially useful if you are unsure if all the data in a column is formatted as numeric.|
|COUNTBLANK & COUNTA|Return the number of blank or non-blank cells in a range.|
|COUNTIF|Return the number of cells when a specific criteria is met.|
|SUMIF|Create a sum based on criteria.|
|AVERAGEIF|Take an average if the cell meets the criteria set in formula.|

* Many basic functions can be enhanced by adding additional criteria such as MINIF and MAXIF.
* LEFT and RIGHT are ways to get to the first or last X number of characters.
A complete list of Excel functions can be found on the Microsoft support page.

|Functions|Use keywords and are predefined by Excel|
|Formulas|users can build custom formulas themselves using operators|

|Reference|Explanation|

|#NULL|The cell range indicated in the formula is entered incorrectly|
|#DIV/0!|A formula entered in a cell causes a divide by 0 error|
|#N/A|The formula refers to an empty cell, so no data is available to compute|
|#REF|The formula refers to a cell that is not accessible, such as a named sheet that doesn't exist|
|#NUM|The formula entered in the cell is invalid|
|#NAME|A non-existent range name is used in a formula|
|#VALUE|A function is used incorrectly, or the arguments are invalid|


## 4.3.3 Lab - Formulas and Functions

##### Objectives
In this lab you will learn the basics of using formulas and functions in Excel.
    Part 1 : Using Excel Text Functions : CONCAT, LEN, LEFT, RIGHT, MID
    Part 2 : Using Excel Statistics Functions : COUNT, COUNTBLANK, COUNTA, COUNTIF, AVERAGEIF, MINIFS, MAXIFS
    Part 3 : Experiment with Other Excel Functions

##### Background / Scenario
Excel has eleven different categories of built-in functions. Many of the functions used by data analysts belong to the Text and Statistical function categories. The Text function category includes CONCAT, LEN, LEFT, RIGHT, and MID. The Statistical function category includes COUNT, COUNTBLANK, COUNTA, COUNTIF, AVERAGEIF, MINIFS, and MAXIFS. This lab will work through the purpose and usage of each of these functions.
