## 9.1.1 Types of Biases
Bias is a natural tendency that all humans have, whether we are aware of it or not. As a data analyst, there are at least five types of biases to be aware of.

1. Conformation bias : Analysts make choices that increase the likelihood of their hypothesis being confirmed or proven true
2. Selection bias : It result from choosing incomplete or non-representative data sets.
3. Interpretation bias : It can occur when there is a misinterpretation of either the question or what the data shows.
4. Information bias : Some data sources may have built-in information bias. Other instances of information bias are caused by outliers in the data and how they are dealt with in analysis.
5. Predictive bias : It can be caused by using historical data that was collected under conditions that differ from the current environment.
