## 9.0.1 Introduction
Data analysis can be impacted by a number of factors other than data that influence outcomes. Bias in the selection and interpretation of data, for example, can create results that may not reflect the true situation. Bias must be identified and mitigated for the results to be valid. Other ethical concerns when working with data involve the privacy and security of data sources; these concerns often pertain to personally identifiable information, or PII. There are a number of global regulations that govern the ethical use of data, and it is important to be aware of them.
