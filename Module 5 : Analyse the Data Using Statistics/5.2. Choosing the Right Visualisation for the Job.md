<br/>
Data visualisation is the graphical representation of information and data. It is used to translate information into a visual context using visual elements, such as charts, graphs, and maps. It is also an accessible way to see and understand trends, outliers, and patterns and data.
Once data is collected, processed, ana analysed, the next stage in the data analysis process is to visualise the data so that conclusions can be drawn.
A good visualisation tells a story, removing the noise from the data and highlighting the useful information. It is with visualisations that data analysts can best tell the stories of when data informs the who, what, when, where and how.
Good visualisations make faster decision making possible because humans can process visual images faster than tables of data, and they help users make better sense of complicated data.
