## 5.5.3 What You Can Do with VLOOKUP
VLOOKUP is a very powerful data analysis tool within Excel and is great when you need to find information in a large spreadsheet or if you are consistently looking for the same type of information.

A VLOOKUP function consists of 4 key pieces of information

1. The value to search for
2. The range to search in
3. The column in the range that contains the value you want the function to return
4. An indication of whether the function should return an approximate match (TRUE, in the function) or only an exact match (FALSE) of the return value. The default for VLOOKUP is an approximate match if FALSE is not specified in the function.
