## 1.1 SQL and Its Installaion
<br/>

### What is a Database?
- Database is a storage system that has a collection of data. Relational databases store data in the form of tables that can be easily retrieved, managed, and updated.
<br/>

### Popular Databases
- MySQL
- Oracle
- MongoDB
- MS SQL Server
- Cassandra
- PostgreSQL
<br/>

### What is SQL?
- SQL is the language to communicate with databases. SQL commands help you to store, process, analyse and manipulate databases.
<br/>

### Features of SQL
- let you access any data within the relational database
- very fast in retrieving large amounts of data very efficiently
- versatile as it works with database systems from Oracle, IBM, MS, etc
- helps you manage databases without knowing lots of coding
<br/>

### Applications of SQL
- used to create a database, define its structure, implement it and lets you perform many functions
- used for maintaining an already existing database. SQL is a powerful language for entering data, modyfing data and extracting data in a database
- extensively used as a Client/Server language to connect the front-end with the back-end thus supporting the Clinet/Server architecture
- helps protect your database from unauthorised access when deployed as Data Control Language(DCL)
<br/>

### What is an Entity Relationship Diagram(ER Diagram)?
- describe the relationship of entities that need to be stored in a database
- mainly a structural design for the datavase. It is a framework using specialised symbols to define the relationship between entities
- created based on three main components entities, attributes, and relationships
<br/>

### Why use ER Diagram?
- help us conceptualise the database and help us know which fields need to be embedded for a particular entity
- give a better understanding of the information to be stored in a database
- reduce complexity and save time which allows you to build databases quickly
- help to describe elements using ER model
<br/>

### Symbols used in ER Diagram
- entity
- attribute
- weak entity
- derived attribute
- relationship
- multivalued attribute
<br/>

### Components of ER Diagram
- entity (weak entity)
- attribute (key, composite, multivalued, derived)
- relationship (one to one, one to many, many to one, many to many)
<br/>

### How to Draw an ER Diagram?
1. identify all the entities. Embed all the entities in a rectangle and label them properly
2. identify relationships between entities and connect them using a diamond in the middle illustrating the relationship.
3. connect attributes for entities and label them properly
4. eradicate any redundant entities or relationships
4. make sure your ER Diagram supports all the data provided to design the database
5. make effective use of colours to highlight key areas
<br/>

### Types of SQL Commands
1. Data Definition Language(DDL) : to change the sturcture of a table
    - CREATE, ALTER, DROP, TRUNCATE
2. Data Manipulation Language(DML) : to modify the database
3. Data Control Language(DCL) : to control access to data
4. Transaction Control Language(TCL) : to manage transaction
<br/>

### SQL Commands Structure
- SELECT
- FROM
- WHERE
- GROUP BY
- HAVING
- ORDER BY
<br/>

### SQL Datatypes
- NUMERIC
- DATE AND TIME
- STRING
- BINARY
<br/>

### SQL Operators
- Arithmetic : +, -, *, /, %
- Logical : ALL, AND, ANY, BETWEEN, EXISTS
- Comparison : =, !=, <>, <, >, >=, <=, !<, !>
