## 7.0.1 Introduction

Structured Query Language (SQL) is used to query relational databases where data can be spread in different tables. SQL can combine the data from multiple tables in order to return complex results and that can help us to perform analysis. In this module, you will use different types of joins to extract and combine data from more than one table.
